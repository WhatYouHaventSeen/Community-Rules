# Community-Rules
This document contains the information you need to successfully participate on [What You Haven't Seen](https://www.youtube.com/c/whatyouhaventseen).

If you want to know what prompted this, see [below](wtf?).

## ABOUT COMMENTS

Following a very frustrating experience that led to my closing comments on the channel, comments are once again open. Your 
first comment must be approved by one of three people, all of whom work for me full-time. This channel isn't their primary 
job, so be patient. 

That said, if your initial comment is not approved within 24 hours you may email me at the appeals address below. That kind of 
delay is something I want to know about so I can fix the issue for you, and hopefully for everyone else in the future.

Once your first comment gets approved all subsequent comments do not need approval. Be aware, however, that they are being 
moderated by a group of ~~nearly~~ more than two-dozen of your peers. You have no idea who they are and it's going to stay 
that way, so consider being nice to each other.

## THE CHANNEL IS SEEKING COMMENT MODERATORS

First, to the new moderators: I can't thank you enough for stepping up and making it possible to reopen comments. That fifteen 
of you responded in ten minutes - and that all of you have a track record commenting on this channel - is a huge vote of 
confidence. I really appreciate it.

If you would like to volunteer as a comment moderator AND you have a track record of reasonably sane commenting on this 
channel, I need your help and would love to have you onboard. You do not need to commit any specific amount of time to this 
channel, the job is easy, and you can resign at any time.

### Applying is simple:

1. Draft an email to modteam@whatyouhaventseen.com.

2. Put the word "Application" as the subject of your email, without quotes.

3. The first word in your email must be the YouTube handle you use to comment on this channel, on its own line, case-sensitive 
and without quotes.

4. The rest of your email can say anything you'd like, but it can also be blank. A one-word email does not impact your chances 
of being selected, but it may speed the review process.

Be aware that your entire post history will be read. Your application will be handled by my staff and I trust the judgement of 
every one of my employees. If your application is rejected it cannot be appealed. 

You will hear back within seven days. Messages directed to me but contained in moderator applications will be forwarded to me.

Let's see how this goes. Please be patient as the kinks are sorted out. 

If you have comments or suggestions, email feedback@whatyouhaventseen.com.

## FURTHER INFORMATION, APPEALS:

If you find yourself unable to comment and you think that is a mistake email appeals@whatyouhaventseen.com. 

I have nothing to do with day-to-day comments on my channel other than setting policy guidelines and participating when I am 
able but I handle all appeals personally. I will do my best to be fair. 

Direct all hate mail to spam@whatyouhaventseen.com.

#### Please remember that I receive more than 100 emails a day related to this channel alone. My staff handles some of them, but it *will* take some time to get back to you.

## CLOSING THOUGHTS

Since I started What You Haven't Seen in June of 2017 more than 15 million unique viewers have spent more than 100 years
engaged with the exclusive content I have investigated and published. What You Haven't Seen has a positive impact on 
transportation safety and it does so while providing news and entertainment to hundreds of thousands of people every day. 
The community is diverse and vibrant, and if you can act like an adult you are welcome to be a part of it. Conversation is 
alive 24/7 and the channel exists to improve transportation safety by providing a transparent and accessible disclosure of the 
facts relating to incidents and accidents. I think I do a pretty good job.

So, the channel. Think of a YouTube channel as a house, and think of my channel as a house that belongs to me. (If that 
doesn't sit well with you, you need to keep reading.)

Like with all houses, if you can't or won't follow the house rules, you will not be allowed in the house. 

In my house I do not allow assholery. That's the house rule. Don't be an asshole. The standard for assholery is 
of course subjective and I have instructed the mod team to err on the side of liberal approvals, but if you are unpleasant to 
be around, I don't want you on my channel and you are going to get banned. Forever.<sup>1</sup>

## WTF?

I'm going to be very direct here, because I don't want there to be any confusion about this.

If you missed the fireworks, you are probably really confused and wondering what led to all this. The answer is: people acting 
as though they had the authority to dictate aspects of my channel and its content.

Get this straight:

I enjoy bringing you the content on my channel, but you get it for free and I spend thousands of dollars and countless hours 
annually bringing it to you. You pay me NOTHING for it and YouTube pays me NOTHING for it. I tried asking for your support - 
even offering exclusive access to material in exchange for it - and out of a literal one-million-plus people who read and saw 
my request, twenty-three people came through, and they did so despite my clear statement that "supporters have no greater 
privilege to dictate any aspect of my content than others." *Every one of those people is awesome for being willing to 
financially support my work, and the overwhelming majority of the rest of you are just as awesome for appreciating and enjoying my content all the same.* I know that I am giving it to you for free and you are not any less of a good human being for accepting what I am giving you for free.

But some of you are different. And I know that you exist, because you made that very clear. Some of you don't understand 
that you are not entitled to tell me how to give you free content. That you are not entitled to tell me how I spend my time. 
You can make requests; hell, you can make even strongly worded requests. Believe me, I can take a lot. But the minute you 
start to tell me what to do you cross a bright line. And I will not tolerate it. To the point that I am literally paying 
people to keep you away.

If things were any different, if I was being paid or given *anything* in exchange for providing you with content, an argument 
could possibly be made that you were entitled to something.<sup>2</sup> But it's NOT different, and if you think that you are 
entitled to *anything* from me, you are delusional. If hearing that is doesn't sit well with you, you are one of the people I 
don't want anything to do with. And you are not going to convince me otherwise. On the other hand, if what I wrote above makes 
sense to you, then - from the bottom of my heart - I thank you for being a normal, decent human being, and I apologize for 
having to institute draconian measures to keep entitled assholes at bay.

Now how about we get back to work?

Peace.

### Footnotes

<sup>1</sup> Google does an excellent job at detecting duplicate accounts created to circumvent bans. I can't speak for 
Google, but there is a good chance that if you attempt to circumvent a ban by creating an alternate account you will have ALL 
of your Google accounts on ALL Google services permanently shut down. You don't want that.

<sup>2</sup> That "something" would *still* not be "telling me what to do."
